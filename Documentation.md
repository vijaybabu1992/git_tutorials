Documenting and presenting your data analysis to stakeholders who may not have coding knowledge is an important step in ensuring that the insights are accessible and actionable. Here's a process for documenting and sharing your analysis on a Confluence page:

**1. Prepare a Report:**
   - Create a report that summarizes your data analysis in a clear, concise, and non-technical manner. This report should include text, visualizations, and key insights.

**2. Use Plain Language:**
   - Avoid technical jargon and use plain language to explain your findings. Assume that your audience does not have a coding background.

**3. Visualize Insights:**
   - Include visualizations that effectively communicate your findings. Use charts, graphs, and tables to illustrate key points.

**4. Structure Your Report:**
   - Organize your report with a logical structure that guides the reader through the analysis. Include sections such as:
     - Executive Summary: A brief overview of the key findings.
     - Introduction: Describe the context and objectives of the analysis.
     - Data Overview: Provide a summary of the dataset.
     - Insights: Present the main findings and conclusions.
     - Visualizations: Include charts and graphs to support your insights.
     - Recommendations: Suggest actions or decisions based on the analysis.

**5. Provide Context:**
   - Explain the significance of your findings and how they relate to the project's goals or objectives.

**6. Share in Confluence:**
   - Create a new Confluence page or update an existing one to host your report.
   - Use Confluence's built-in editing tools to format and structure your report.

**7. Shareable Link:**
   - Generate a shareable link for the Confluence page so that stakeholders can access it without needing to log in.

**8. Presentation Mode (Optional):**
   - If you're presenting the analysis in person, consider using Confluence's "Presentation" mode to guide your audience through the report interactively.

**9. Seek Feedback:**
   - Encourage stakeholders to provide feedback or ask questions. Create a comment section on the Confluence page for this purpose.

**10. Regular Updates (Optional):**
    - If the analysis is part of an ongoing project, update the Confluence page as new data or insights become available.

By following this process, you can create a user-friendly, accessible report that conveys your analysis and insights to a non-technical audience. Confluence provides a collaborative platform for sharing, discussing, and documenting your work effectively.
